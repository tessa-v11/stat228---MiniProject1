# Stat228 - MiniProject1

This repository contains my Stat 228 mini project about data analysis and visualization using R.

## Project Guidelines

You will write a blog post that contains data visualizations. Your goal is to tell us something interesting using well-crafted, thoughtfully-prepared data graphics. Your blog post doesnâ€™t need to be long. You should have (at least):
- An introduction: text explaining the context to your data
- Analysis: text explaining your data analysis results
- Discussion: text interpreting and contextualizing your data findings
- Data visualizations using ggplot2: at least 1 figure, though preferably at least 2
- Additionally, ensure that all figures and text are clear, well-structured, and professional

## Finer details

- Show your code in your blog post, but only the minimal code that is necessary to produce your plot not all the code that you wrote in the process of doing this assignment
- Make sure you disable any unnecessary messages that appear when loading packages, warning messages from plots, etc. Do this by using appropriate chunk options
- Use a a catchy and/or engaging title
